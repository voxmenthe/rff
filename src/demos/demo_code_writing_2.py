Demonstration of the CodeWritingSpec with a Controller and LLM *for a multi-step problem*.

This demo intentionally poses a task that cannot be solved in a single shot so
that the Reason-from-Future (RFF) loop must incrementally plan out modules,
classes, and tests.  The chosen problem is a **tiny URL shortener library**.
